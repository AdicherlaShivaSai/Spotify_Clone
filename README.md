HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three technologies that are commonly used to create dynamic websites. HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS handles the styling and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity and behavior to the page. Together, they can be used to create a Spotify Clone. It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to choose the music and listen to it.
